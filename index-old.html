                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>Augmented Reality (AR) is a view of the environment of the real world, augmented with computer generated graphics, sound, video, or GPS data which is usually seen through the lens of a camera. AR is implemented for many purposes such
                        as marketing, educational, and recreational. Future potential usage of AR is yet to be improved. Unlike VR, which is a closed service that confines a user in a virtual space that can be used only in a limited space, AR can be used on the move. In a word, if VR is writing a console gaming device on the face, it is said that AR is like using a transparent mobile phone.

                    <h3>Street Museum</h3>
                    <div class="text-container">
                      <p>Street Museum is an application that allows you to see London of the past through your smartphoneÅfs camera. While you are exploring modern-day London, you can see old London using this application. This application uses GPS data to generate the virtual images of old London on your smartphone. As you walk through historical sites of London, this application will be able to generate virtual images of present-day London when that specific historical event has occurred.</p>

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>AR promotes and further encourages and engages users to become more interested in the subject. Heightened focus and interest was demonstrated by the majority of students when AR technology was integrated in scholastic material and
                        increases eagerness and attention was demonstrated by the users. AR led to increased concentration alongside satisfaction. It is believed that traditional methods of the learning process can become too slow or boring for users,
                        and that AR engages these users to make it more fun and interesting. Archaic methods of teaching such as lecturing off a slideshow could now be replaced by active AR models that engage students into learning the material. AR models
                        can also allow more fine line details and zoom options that previous images could not provide. Increased creativity was observed in the participants. Costs of materials were driven down in some instances, as you do not have to
                        continually buy updated new textbooks when you can provide new software.</p>

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>The 3DS has an AR feature using cards and its camera.
Spinmaster has an app for AR usage with a drone.
You must complete ÅgmissionsÅh by flying your small drone past small rings that are displayed on the screen of your device.
These kinds of recreational uses of AR are beneficial in a way that requires less materials (=good for the environment). Therefore, fewer toys will be thrown away in the future.
Ingress and Pokemon Go is a game that is played made to go outside.
On the contrary, AR games such as the ones on the 3DS and the one that Spinmaster created can keep people inside all day, but they will think that it isnÅft necessary to go outside because there is a whole computer generated world right there for them on their devices.

                <h3>AR-Issues with Safety and Privacy</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                  <p>Ingress has a COMM feature that displays a playerÅfs activity within a range of area.
Stalking and harassment is a common concern for most players especially because the location is publically broadcasted to all players via the COMM.
Players often walk and drive while playing Ingress, and safety is also a concern on the streets when players donÅft pay attention to where they are going

                <h2>Future Research/Improvement</h2>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>AR technology is a technique that is routinely experienced in living space. It is expected that a wide range of uses will be developed, and it is necessary to conduct precise research in various fields. 1. The AR technology, which
                        is expected to be a tool for everyday communication, constitutes living space experiences such as home, office space, outdoor, and transportation, and is expected to have widespread influence on people's relations and social structure
                        in the future. It is necessary to study not only side effects such as privacy invasion, personal information, cyber bulling, but also study of comprehensive information of individuals, community, and social networks, for data-based
                        sociological research and policy development can be used. 2. Because AR's five-sensory technology is a technology that utilizes the cognitive characteristics of people, technology-based, large-scale and precise technology to improve
                        and minimize biological, medical and biological user research is needed.User studies of unstructured, small-scale case-based ARs can be the basis for premature regulation, so a robust scientific and empirical approach would ensure
                        a secure safety and user research to improve satisfaction. 3. As AR technology is applied to various fields, various issues may arise. It is necessary to establish a public-private cooperation system that can respond quickly these
                        issues. Every time new technology is introduced, various existing guidelines and laws of the ministry, Special market conditions appear as an obstacle. In order for new technology startups to overcome these obstacles by themselves,
                        legal and administrative issues are too high of complexity. AR is a technology that must be preempted as a future growth industry. It is necessary to establish a public-private partnership system capable of responding promptly
                        through specialized knowledge and roles. 4. Expansion of facilities for developers and companies, sharing of technology and business supporting infrastructure and environment necessary for technology development. Recently, various
                        types of AR devices have been developed and more expensive devices are being used, and for any people, it is difficult to have all of them. Enviornment support is needed to test and experience services rather than supporting events
                        based on unilateral announcements by international celebrities. Also, it encourages small metworking events, such as MeetUp to creat their own event, build, and share resources and information.</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Factors that must be met in order for AR to be distributed to mass users:</h2>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>Mobility: AR can be used anywhere without blocking the real world, and this degree of freedom is an important advantage. However, to compete with existing mobile devices, you need to have more mobility. To do this, you do not need
                        to tie your device somewhere, you need to be able to use your battery all day, and you should be able to use voice and data services at the current mobile device level. If you can not make phone calls or browse the web from outside,
                        it will be difficult to replace your smartphone today. Flexibility: The AR is expected to evolve into a computing device with common usability, and the applications available are expected to be at the current smartphone and tablet
                        level. Therefore, you must provide an SDK or a cross-platform OS. In mixed reality, it may be useful to switch from AR to VR mode. Wearability: Develop a product that can be worn without compromising aesthetics. In the case of
                        AR, there are obstacles that various elements must be satisfied in terms of design, suitability and weight for external use.
