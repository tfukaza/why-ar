# why-ar
Website me and my team made in a high school web development competition. It is being hosted on GitHub pages for archive purposes.

Team members:
- Tomoki Fukazawa (me)
- Lisa Takai
- Patrick Kol
- Anthony Chong
- Katherine Choi

The website is not the version we submitted for the competition, but a near-final version with most of the elements done but the texts mostly being place-holders.
